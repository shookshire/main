== PROJECT: TuitionCor

---

== Overview

TuitionCor is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: *Morphed AddressBook - Level 4 into TuitionCor by adding support for clients in model, logic, storage*
** What it does: Extends or changes the Person related fields and commands in AddressBook to suit Clients in TuitionCor
** Justification: This changes the original AddressBook into TuitionCor and lay the foundation for future enhancements of TuitionCor.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a remove command that allows user to easily edit the the frequently edited subjects without having to re-type the entire remaining subjects.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/functional/shookshire.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/shookshire.md[Test code]]

* *Other contributions*:

** Enhancements to existing features:

*** Edited the existing add, edit, delete commands to work on the new Client class instead (Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/pull/81[#81], https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/pull/30[#30])
*** Remove command (Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/pull/89[#89])

*** Edited existing junit test to work on clients after changes were made to logic and model (Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/pull/31[#31])
*** Allowed for multiple subjects, grades and location to be added with regex checking for each keyword individually instead of as a whole. (Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/pull/89[#89])
** Documentation:

== Proposed implementations/features

* Automatic close feature
** Instead of throwing an error when the user tries to remove the last subject from a client, ask the user if he would prefer to close the client. If yes, call the close function for the given client.
* Function for changing the grades of the students
** All the students would promote to the next grade at the end of every year eg. from p1 to p2. This feature would allow for the user to easily change all the student's grades at the end of each school year instead of having to manually edit their profile.
** Alternatively, if a clock/calender feature is to be implemented in the future, this function can sync with that clock/calender to automatically change the grades of all the students at the end of the school year.
