== Introduction

TuitionCor is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing client information*. More importantly, TuitionCor is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TuitionCor can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `TuitionCor.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your client information.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

*Command Format*


* There are alias for some of the commands, which helps users to save some time. e.g. for add command, you can use add n/... or a n/...
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a client: `addclient` {Since v1.2}

Adds a client to TuitionCor +
Format: `addclient c/CATEGORY n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]... l/LOCATION g/GRADE s/SUBJECT`

Alias Format: `ac c/CATEGORY n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]... l/LOCATION g/GRADE s/SUBJECT`
[TIP]
A client can have any number of tags (including 0)

[NOTE]
User can only enter only a specific location and a specific grade for each client. The type of location and grade accepted can be found below.

****
* It's required to indicate the category the particular client belongs to.
* Accepted case-insensitive location available for user input are {North,South,East,West,Central}. Any other type of location will be invalid.
* Accepted case-insensitive grade available for user input are as follows:
** Format of grade are in this particular format 'LEVEL YEAR' or alias format 'ALIASLEVEL YEAR' without any spacing in-between. Example: 'Primary 1' or 'P1'.
** LEVEL available are {Kindergarten, Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, University}. Alias LEVEL are {K,P,S,J,U} respectively.
** INDEX available varies differently for each Level.
*** For Kindergarten INDEX available are {1,2,3}.
*** For Primary INDEX available are {1,2,3,4,5,6}.
*** For Secondary INDEX available are {1,2,3,4,5}.
*** For Tertiary INDEX available are {1,2}.
*** For University INDEX available are {1,2,3,4}
* Subject are split based on black space. Hence a single subject has to be typed without any space.
** Example: "chinese studies" would be treated as two separate subject "chinese" and "studies" by other commands. Hence it should be typed without a blank space such as "chineseStudies".
