By: `Team F11-B2`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `TutorListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a client) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1 c/s")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1 c/s` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

// tag::modelComponent[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// end::modelComponent[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::modelImplementation[]

=== Model
==== Current Implementation

The AddressBook currently stores Clients in separate UniqueClientList (students, tutors, closedStudents, closedTutors) depending on category the Client belongs to.

Due to students and tutors being stored as 2 separate UniqueClientList, commands that work on only 1 of the 2 list (eg. addclient, edit, delete etc.) would require the model to either expose 2 functions for the Command to call or to take in a Category argument which the model would then handle as shown below.

image::StudentTutorList.png[width="800"]

Commands that work only on either students or tutors would have to declare which Category they wish to work on in the command input. For example for the delete command would have to input `delete 1 c/s` to represent that they wish to delete from students.

Hence, commands that work only on either students or tutors have to either be split into 2 functions or take in an additional argument stating which UniqueClientList to work on as shown below.

.Example of splitting call into 2 functions
image::SeparateFunctionForStudentTutor.png[width="800"]

----
public class updatePerson(Client target, Client editedClient, Category category) {
    if (category.isStudent) {
        // ... work on students ...
    } else if (category.isTutor) {
        // ... work on tutors ...
    }
}
----
Example of function that takes in additional argument to determine whether to work on students or tutors

==== Design Considerations of Model

===== Aspect: Keeping students and tutors in 1 or 2 list
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Keep students and tutors separated in 2 UniqueClientList
** Pros: Does not have to do an additional search through the list to differentiate students and tutors
** Cons: Calls that work on only one of the 2 list would have to be separated.
* **Alternative 2:** Keep all clients in the same UniqueClientList and differentiate them using the clients' Category value
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Have to run an additional search through the list to differentiate students and tutors which could be slow when database is large.

===== Aspect: Whether to have different commands for students and tutors
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make the Category prefix compulsory for any command that work on only 1 list
** Pros: Minimises number of commands and use already existing prefix instead.
** Cons: Needs to parse an additional prefix
* **Alternative 2:** Have separate commands (eg. deleteStudent and deleteTutor instead of just delete)
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Large number of duplicated commands.

=== Client and the fields of Client
==== Current Implementation

The Client Class extends Person that consists of 5 fields (name, phone, email, address, tags) while Client has additional 4 fields (location, grade, subject, category).

All of the fields uses a specific class that takes a single String as it's value as shown below.

.Example of Subject field with it's value
image::ClientFieldExample.png[width="800"]

Hence, for fields that should actually take in multiple values (eg. Subject taking in "math physics chemistry") are currently stored as a single String while operations that work on the individual keywords have to manually split them into separate keywords through String operations.

----
private static Client createEditedPerson(Client personToEdit, Subject toRemove) {
        assert personToEdit != null;

        String editSubjects = personToEdit.getSubject().value;
        ArrayList<String> editSubjectArray = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(editSubjects.split(" ")));
        editSubjectArray.remove(toRemove.value);

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        .....
----

As you can see from this section taken from Remove Command, after getting the String of the value of Subject, it has to use String operations to split it based on whitespace and reconstruct the string again later.

On the other hand, a client can have multiple Tags as the Tag are stored through an UniqueTagList.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: To store multiple values in a single String or as separate objects in a list
* **(Alternative 1 (current choice)):** Store all the values as a single String and have commands that work on individual keywords split them.
** Pros: Most commands simply require to read the value directly as a String and does not require to work on individual keyword. Does not require multiple types of unique list to be created for each of the field.
** Cons: Lacks in flexibility in being able to individual values.
* **(Alternative 2)** Create a list similar to UniqueTagList for each field that requires the storage of multiple values
** Pros: Allows for greater flexibility and the ability to sync the various existing values in the AddressBook.
** Cons: Require many lists to be stored. Whenever more fields are added in future enhancements, it could potentially require the excessive creation of a new type unique list each time.

// end::modelImplementation[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::match[]
=== Match Function
==== Current Implementation
The match function behaves like a multi-layer find function. It helps to match clients that share one or more similar attributes.

For example, John is a Tutor client that is staying in the `west` of Singapore, and is looking for students that requires help in `s4`(secondary4) `math`.

first, locate John by either using `find John` or finding him in the tutor list. Observe John's Index number.

image::MatchSequence1.png[width="800']

from the sample image above, we can see that John's index number is 6 in tutors list.

image::MatchSequence2.png[width="800']
Keying in the command in the format `match` `INDEX` `Category`. eg: `match 6 c/t`

image::MatchSequence3.png[width="800']
Match function returns a list with all the potential students for John with the highest match (all attributes matched) on top of the list.

All the matched attributes are highlighted in orange.

==== Step by Step breakdown

match function behaves like at double-layered find function. When a user enters `match 1 c/t`, the system will first need to extract the first tutor from the tutor's list.

To do this, first we need to identify the client is a tutor or a student.

The detailed code is shown below:
[source,java]
----
if (category.isStudent()) {
            lastShownList = model.getFilteredStudentList();
        } else {
            lastShownList = model.getFilteredTutorList();
        }
        clientToMatch = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());

----

[NOTE]
If the user input format is invalid, an exception will be thrown


When the client is located, his data (location, grade and subject) are then sent to `MatchContainsKeywordsPredicate.java`

The detailed code is shown below:

[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public boolean test(Client other) {
        boolean isMatch = false;

        if(other.getLocation().equals(client.getLocation())) {
            isMatch = true;
        }
        if(other.getGrade().equals(client.getGrade())) {
            isMatch = true;
        }
        if(other.getSubject().equals(client.getSubject())) {
            isMatch = true;
        }
        return isMatch;
    }

----
[NOTE]
If there is no match client found, an empty list will be shown.

image::MatchZeroClient.png[width="800']

If the input client is a tutor, the tutor list will only be showing the particular of the input client.

image::MatchSequence3.png[width="800']

this is done in MatchContainsPersonsPredicate.java
The detailed code is shown below:

[source,java]
----
public boolean test(Client other) {
        return other.toString().equals(client.toString());
    }
----
A sequence diagram is shown below to show the current design when user input "match 1 c/s"

image::MatchSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: UserInput

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User key in client index displayed with with client's category. e.g `match 1 c/t`.
** Pros: There will be no mismatch since user specify the exact client to match with.
** Cons: More user input and extra step is taken. User have to locate the client's index first before using match function.
* **Alternative 2:** user key in the client's name. e.g `match John`.
** Pros: More convenient for user to operate, lesser steps.
** Cons: If there are 2 John stored in the application, there is a chance for the application to match a wrong client.

==== Future Implementations
===== Optimise match function to accommodate multiple `Grade` and `Subject` fields per client.

image::MatchFunctionFutureImplementation.png[width="800"]

* As illustrated above, match function currently highlights all the grades/subjects of a client as long as one of the grade/subject is matched.
* Future Implementation could be done to only highlight the respective matched grade/subject.
// end::match[]

// tag::sorting[]
=== Sort feature
==== Current Implementation

The sort command is facilitated by a `SortCommandParser` which implements `Parser<SortCommand>`. The sort function supports sorting of different fields, namely location, grade, subject and name, which updates the list according to the sorting method.

Different types of sorting methods extends abstract class `SortCommand` which extends `Command` that resides in Logic as shown in the model below.

image::SortCommandClassDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

The different type of sort command are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class SortByNameCommand extends SortCommand {
     @Override
     public CommandResult execute() {
         // ... list logic ...
     }
}

public class SortByLocationCommand extends SortCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}

public class SortByGradeCommand extends SortCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}

public class SortBySubjectCommand extends SortCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

When the user wants to sort the specific list according to his/her needs, `SortCommandParser` will parse the user input and decide which type of SortCommand to invoke.
The implementation is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public SortCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        requireNonNull(args);
        ArgumentMultimap argumentMultimap = ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_CATEGORY);

        if (!arePrefixesPresent(argumentMultimap, PREFIX_CATEGORY)
                || argumentMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, SortCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }

        String sortType;
        Category category;

        try {
            sortType = argumentMultimap.getPreamble();
            category = ParserUtil.parseCategory(argumentMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_CATEGORY)).get();
            return getSortCommandType(category, sortType);
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, SortCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    }
----

[NOTE]
If the user input format is invalid, an ParseException will be thrown and an error message will be displayed to user.

A sequence diagram is shown below to show the current design when user input "sort l c/t".

image::SortSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800']

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of the different sort commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make SortCommand an abstract method and allow the different sort commands to inherit from it.
** Pros: Able to reuse constants from SortCommand
** Cons: SortCommand might be redundant
* **Alternative 2:** Implement multiple sort commands which extends command directly
** Pros: Might be easier to implement
** Cons: Messy

====== Aspect: Parsing of user input for sort command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** SortCommandParser parse one single string user input. Eg. 'sort l c/t' which sort tutor list by location.
** Pros: Able to utilise the current Logic and Model Component for command inputs
** Cons: Less intuitive to user.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow multiple user input of before parsing to a command. Eg. User input sort and system will prompts for user to input which list to sort.
** Pros: This is much more intuitive for user and allows further enhancements which require multiple command inputs.
** Cons: This will require to overhaul of Logic and Model Component.


// end::sorting[]

// tag::closedClientList[]
=== Closed client list
==== Current Implementation

The closed client list is where closed clients students or tutors information are stored and displayed.

The implementation of the storage is similar to how clients are stored in the TuitionCor. Two `UniqueClientList` namely `closedStudents` and `closedTutors` were created to store the information of closed students and tutors.

The addition of clients into their respective `UniqueClientList` are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
    public void addClosedStudent(Client t) throws AssertionError {
        closedStudents.add(closedStudent);
    }

   public void addClosedTutor(Client t) throws AssertionError {
        closedTutors.add(closedTutor);
    }

   public void add(Client toAdd) throws AssertionError {
        requireNonNull(toAdd);
        if (contains(toAdd)) {
            throw new AssertionError("It's impossible to have a duplicate person here");
        }
        internalList.add(toAdd);
   }
----

[NOTE]
 An `AssertionError` is also thrown as there should not exist any duplicated person in the active list.

Implementation of the removal of clients from the list are as follows:
[source,java]
----
    public boolean removeClosedClient(Client key, Category category) throws PersonNotFoundException {
        Boolean isSuccess;

        if (category.isStudent()) {
            isSuccess = closedStudents.remove(key);
        } else {
            isSuccess = closedTutors.remove(key);
        }

        if (isSuccess) {
            return true;
        } else {
            throw new PersonNotFoundException();
        }
    }
----

With the addition of closed client list, certain commands will be unique to only closed or active client list

Commands available in closed client's list: +
`clear` `exit` `find` `help` `history` `list` `redo` `undo` `restore` `switch`

Commands available in active client's list: +
`addclient` `clear` `close` `delete` `edit` `exit` `find` `help` `history` `list` `match` `redo` `undo` `remove` `sort` `switch`


A check is implemented this way in all commands features that available only when viewing active client list:

[source,java]
----
    if (!ListPanelController.isCurrentDisplayActiveList()) {
        throw new CommandNotAvailableInClosedViewException();
    }
----
This allows `CommandNotAvailableInClosedViewException` to be thrown when the
user is attempts to use a command unique to active list view while viewing closed list view.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Integration of commands which were unique to active client list to closed client list.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Limit the number of commands available to closed clients list.
** Pros: This is easier to implement as there would be less changes to existing commands as certain commands are not relevant while viewing closed client list.
** Cons: Design of unique commands would still have to be changed if they were to be made available to both list.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow the display to automatically switch to either closed or active list list where the command is available upon user input.
** Pros: This is more intuitive to users.
** Cons: This is much harder to implement as this would include require changes to be made to the command structure.
// end::closedClientList[]

// tag::close[]
=== Close feature
==== Current Implementation

The close command allows users to remove a particular client from the active client's list and stores it in the closed client's list.

* CloseCommand extends `UndoableCommand` and this is an undoable command. It overwrites `executeUndoableCommand` in abstract class `UndoableCommand`.

** It will first remove the the selected client from the active client list. If this particular client is not found, a `PersonNotFoundException` will be thrown.
** After which, the particular removed client will be added to the closed client list. An `AssertionError` will be thrown if a duplicated client is detected as it should not be possible to have a duplicated client in the active client list in TuitionCor.

The implementation is as follows:
[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        requireNonNull(clientToClose);
        try {
            model.deleteClient(clientToClose, category);
        } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target client cannot be missing");
        }

        try {
            if (category.isStudent()) {
                model.addClosedStudent(clientToClose);
            } else {
                model.addClosedTutor(clientToClose);
            }
        } catch (DuplicatePersonException e) {
            throw new AssertionError("The client should not be duplicated");
        }

        if (category.isStudent()) {
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_CLOSE_STUDENT_SUCCESS, clientToClose));
        } else {
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_CLOSE_TUTOR_SUCCESS, clientToClose));
        }
    }
----

A sequence diagram is shown below to show the current design when a user input "close 1 c/s"

image::CloseSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of the close command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Current implementation calls model component twice to execute deleteClient and addClosedStudent or addClosedTutor.
** Pros: This ensures that deleteClient is able to execute successfully before addClosedStudent is executed.
** Cons: This reduces code efficiency.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement a closeClient method in model to execute deleteClient and addClosedStudent or addClosedTutor.
** Pros: Model can be called once.
** Cons: New developers might no understand as this reduces code readability.

// end::close[]


// tag::restore[]
=== Restore feature

==== Current Implementation
The restore command allows users to remove a particular client from the closed client's list and restore it back to the active client's list.

* `RestoreCommand` extends `UndoableCommand` and this is an undoable command. It overwrites `executeUndoableCommand` in abstract class `UndoableCommand`.

** It will first remove the the selected client from the closed client list. If this particular client is not found, a `PersonNotFoundException` will be thrown.
** After which, the particular removed client will be added to the active client list. An AssertionError will be thrown if a duplicated client is detected as it should not be possible to have a duplicated client in the closed client list in TuitionCor.

* This design is very similar to close command's design.

The implementation is as follows:
[source,java]
----
@Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        requireNonNull(clientToRestore);
        try {
            model.deleteClosedClient(clientToRestore, category);
        } catch (PersonNotFoundException pnfe) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target client cannot be missing");
        }

        try {
            if (category.isStudent()) {
                model.addStudent(clientToRestore);
            } else {
                model.addTutor(clientToRestore);
            }
        } catch (DuplicatePersonException e) {
            throw new AssertionError("The client should not be duplicated");
        }

        if (category.isStudent()) {
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_RESTORE_STUDENT_SUCCESS, clientToRestore));
        } else {
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_CLOSE_TUTOR_SUCCESS, clientToRestore));
        }
    }
----

A sequence diagram is shown below to show the current design when a user input "restore 1 c/s"

image::RestoreSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

// end::restore[]

// tag::switch[]
=== Switch feature
==== Current Implementation

Switch commands allows user to toggle between the active and closed client's list and it extends `Command`.

* Implementation of Switch command that overrides `execute()` method in `Command` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ClientListSwitchEvent());
        listPanelController.switchDisplay();
        if (listPanelController.getCurrentListDisplayed() == ListPanelController.DisplayType.closedList) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS + MESSAGE_CLOSED_DISPLAY_LIST);
        } else {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS + MESSAGE_ACTIVE_DISPLAY_LIST);
        }
    }
----

* A `ListPanelController` is used to keep track of the currently displayed list and switch the list when called.

[source, java]
----
    public void switchDisplay() {
        switch (currentlyDisplayed) {
        case activeList:
            currentlyDisplayed = DisplayType.closedList;
            break;

        case closedList:
            currentlyDisplayed = DisplayType.activeList;
            break;

        default:
            throw new AssertionError("This should not be possible.");
        }
    }
----

* Switch command uses `ClientListSwitchEvent` to raise an event whenever the user wants to toggle the list displayed.

[source,java]
----
   public class ClientListSwitchEvent extends BaseEvent {

       @Override
       public String toString() {
           return this.getClass().getSimpleName();
       }
   }
[source,java]
----

* When a event is raise it's handled by `handleClientListSwitchEvent` which resides in both `StudentListPanel` and `TutorListPanel`.

[source,java]
----
    @Subscribe
    private void handleClientListSwitchEvent(ClientListSwitchEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        switchListDisplay();
    }
----

* This will allow `StudentListPanel` and `TutorListPanel` to be updated accordingly based on the current list that is on display.

[source,java]
----
    private void switchListDisplay() {
        ListPanelController listPanelController = ListPanelController.getInstance();
        switch (listPanelController.getCurrentListDisplayed()) {
        case activeList:
            setConnectionsForClosedStudents();
            break;

        case closedList:
            setConnectionsForStudents();
            break;

        default:
            throw new AssertionError("This should not be possible.");
        }
    }
----

* A sequence diagram is shown below when switch command is entered by user.

image::SwitchSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of switch command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Raise new event to indicate switch event.
** Pros: Reduce direct coupling between components StudentListPanel and TutorListPanel with SwitchCommand
** Cons: Code might be harder to understand.
* **Alternative 2:** Call a method in StudentListPanel and TutorListPanel to indicate a switch request.
** Pros: Code is easier to understand.
** Cons: Direct coupling occurs and changing a part might affect another component.
// end::switch[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

.. Test case: `remove 1 c/s s/math` +
   Assumption1: First student in TuitionCor has "math" in the Subject field. For example the Subject field is "physics chemistry math english". Otherwise, replace "math" in the command with a word in the Subject field of the client.
   Assumption2: First student in TuitionCor has more than 1 keyword in Subject field. (Each keyword is a single word separated by whitespace)
   Expected: "math" would be removed from Subject field of the first student. Given the above example, the remaining Subjects should be "physics chemistry english". Success message would be given. Timestamp in status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `remove 1 c/s s/math` +
   Assumption: First student in TuitionCor does not have "math" in the Subject field.
   Expected: Error message "The inputted message does not exist"
